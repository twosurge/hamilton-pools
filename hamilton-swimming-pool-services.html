"text": "B usually stands for &#39;backstroke&#39;, another swimming stroke where you swim on your back. Occasionally, it could also indicate &#39;butterfly&#39;, though &#39;fly&#39; is more common. In training drills, &#39;B&#39; might represent &#39;buoy&#39; used for specific exercises."

"Keywords": ["muriatic acid in pool"," high pH"," cloudiness"," skin irritation"," chlorine effectiveness"," measurement"],
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Muriatic acid (diluted hydrochloric acid) lowers high pH levels in pool water. High pH makes water cloudy, irritates skin, and hinders chlorine effectiveness. Use it cautiously and only after measuring pH to avoid over-acidification!"

"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Bleach (sodium hypochlorite) can be used for temporary chlorination, but it&#39;s not a long-term substitute for pool chlorine. Bleach lacks stabilizers present in pool chlorine, making it less effective and potentially damaging to pool surfaces and equipment. Consult a professional for safe and effective pool sanitation!"

"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Stubborn algae needs a multi-pronged approach. First, shock the pool to kill off active growth. Then, use a pool brush to agitate the dead algae, and manualy scoop or net it out. Consider algaecide for long-term prevention. Remember, regular skimming and brushing prevent these issues!"

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Patience is key! Depending on the algae severity, it might take 24-48 hours for shock to kill the algae and clear the water. Maintain proper circulation and resist the urge to add more shock too soon. Let the existing dose work its magic!"

It might refer to &#39;crawl&#39;, the freestyle swimming stroke, or &#39;chlorine&#39;, the primary sanitizer used in pools.
