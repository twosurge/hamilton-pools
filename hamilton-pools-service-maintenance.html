Salinity refers to the amount of dissolved salt in the water, and it plays a crucial role in the chemistry of your pool. Saltwater pools are becoming increasingly popular due to their lower maintenance and the natural feel of the water. However, maintaining the right salinity levels is essential for ensuring a clean and safe swimming environment.</p>

<div class="mt-2 mb-0 c1dc12db600ff336cac6d649d15be4669"> <p>In our pool maintenance process, we utilize diatomaceous earth as a filter media in our pool filtration systems. The diatomaceous earth is added to the filter tank, where it forms a layer on the filter grids. As the water passes through the filter, the diatomaceous earth captures debris, dirt, and other impurities, leaving the water clean and clear.</p><p>In addition to algae treatment, we also address mineral buildup in your pool. Minerals such as calcium and iron can accumulate over time, leading to staining on pool surfaces and equipment. Our specialized mineral treatment products effectively break down and remove these deposits, restoring the beauty and functionality of your pool.</p><p>With our rich background in the pool cleaning and repair industry, Hamilton Pools has solidified its commitment to providing unparalleled quality in all aspects of pool care. We understand the importance of customer satisfaction and strive to deliver exceptional customer service every step of the way.</p></div>
