Our high-quality equipment, such as Pentair pumps and sand filters, ensures that the water in your pool remains crystal clear. We also provide valuable guidance on the proper use of flocculants (floc) for water clarity, helping you maintain the perfect balance of chemicals for optimal pool performance.</p><p>Regular maintenance of your pool is essential for ensuring its longevity and optimal performance. At Hamilton Pools, we understand that your pool is not just a body of water, but your personal oasis—a place of relaxation and enjoyment. That's why we emphasize the importance of regular maintenance to keep your pool in its pinnacle condition.</p><p>If you find that the salinity levels in your saltwater pool are too low or too high, you can adjust them accordingly. If the salinity is too low, you can add pool-grade salt to raise the levels. On the other hand, if the salinity is too high, you can dilute the water with fresh water. It's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions and consult a professional if you're unsure about the correct adjustments.</p>
