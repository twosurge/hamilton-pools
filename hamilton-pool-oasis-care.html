It helps to improve the effectiveness of certain pool chemicals, such as chlorine, by providing a larger surface area for the chemical to react with the water. This ensures that the pool water is properly sanitized and safe for swimming.</p><p>At Hamilton Pools, we understand the importance of maintaining a properly functioning filtration system. That's why we offer comprehensive pool repair services to address any issues that may arise with your pool's filtration system. Whether it's a minor repair or a major overhaul, our technicians have the expertise to get your filtration system back on track.</p><p>The ideal salinity level for a saltwater pool is typically around 3,000 to 4,000 parts per million (ppm). This level provides a comfortable swimming experience while also preventing corrosion of pool equipment and minimizing the risk of algae growth. To measure the salinity levels in your pool, you can use a saltwater test kit, which is readily available at most pool supply stores.</p>
