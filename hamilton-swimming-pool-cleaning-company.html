"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Shocking kills existing algae, but doesn&#39;t remove it. Vacuum the pool thoroughly after shocking to capture dead algae debris. Consider using flocculant to clump smaller particles before vacuuming for efficient removal. Maintain proper filtration and circulation to prevent future build-up!"

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, acts as a natural pH adjuster in pools. It raises the pH level, counteracting acidity caused by chlorine and preventing skin irritation and cloudy water. Use it sparingly; excess baking soda can hinder chlorine&#39;s effectiveness."

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Shock and patience! Apply a proper shock dose based on your pool size and instructions. Maintain good circulation and resist the urge to add more shock too soon. It might take 24-48 hours for the shock to kill the algae and clear the water. Vacuuming afterwards speeds up the process!"
