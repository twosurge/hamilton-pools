"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Shocking your pool with a high dose of chlorine is the fastest way to kill existing algae. However, it&#39;s not a long-term solution. Maintain proper water chemistry, including chlorine levels and pH balance, to prevent future algae growth. Brushing and vacuuming regularly also help!"

"@type": "Answer",

Think of regular chlorine as everyday cleaning, and shock as a deep clean to boost sanitation occasionally!"
